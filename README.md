# Firebase Authentication Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of Firebase Authentication in a React application. It provides user authentication features, including account creation, login, logout, and secure access to protected resources. The project is designed to showcase best practices in integrating Firebase Authentication with a modern frontend framework.

## Features
- User Registration: Allow new users to create an account using their email and password.
- User Login: Authenticate existing users securely with their email and password.
- User Logout: Enable users to log out of their accounts.
- Authentication State Management: Dynamically update the UI based on the user's authentication status.


## Technologies Used
- Frontend: React (JavaScript)
- Backend/Authentication: Firebase Authentication
- State Management: React Context API (or any state management library you used)
- Routing: React Router DOM
